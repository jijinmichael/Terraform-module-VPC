# Terraform-module-VPC

The configuration can be contained and reused across several projects or contexts by turning a resource into a Terraform module. Creating a Terraform module for the establishment of a VPC is demonstrated here.

> A methodical approach

* Create a new directory for your module, such as **terraform-modules** or name its as you like.
* Inside the **terraform-modules** directory, create some files named as main.tf,variables.tf,output.tf,datasource.tf
